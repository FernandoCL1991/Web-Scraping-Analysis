I scraped data from several websites containing infromation about Mars using BeautifulSoup. Data includes headlines with the latest Mars news, images of Mars, tweets about the Mars weather and a table of Mars facts.

After scraping, I stored the data in MongoDB and then loaded it into an HTML file using a Flask/Jinja template that interfaces with Python.

Finally, I formatted the HTML using Bootstrap and configured the app such that clicking a button on the webpage would re-scrape and load the data.

Prerequisites (Python libraries)
flask
flask_pymongo
BeautifulSoup and splinter.
The initial data scraping can be run either in a Jupyter Notebook or in Python.

Built using: Python / Jupyter Notebook Pandas BeautifulSoup Flask Splinter / Selenium MongoDB HTML 5.0 Bootstrap
